This is an exercise in learning how to use Keras/TensorFlow.

I really don't know what I'm doing.  I'm mostly blindly following the
examples in the documentation without knowing what most of the
terminology is or what most of the parameters mean.

First set of predictions for 2019 week 7 (other runs will give
different results) (the Miami-Buffalo prediction looks particularly
ridiculous):
